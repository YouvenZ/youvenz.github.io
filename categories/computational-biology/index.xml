&lt;p>Recent advances in deep learning have transformed many fields, including computational biology. In particular, protein structure prediction has been a long-standing challenge that has seen remarkable progress through the application of machine learning techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our study, we developed a novel neural network architecture that combines convolutional layers with attention mechanisms to better capture the spatial relationships between amino acids. The model was trained on a dataset of 50,000 known protein structures from the Protein Data Bank.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
