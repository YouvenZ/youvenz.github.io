## Introduction

Recent advances in deep learning have transformed many fields, including computational biology. In particular, protein structure prediction has been a long-standing challenge that has seen remarkable progress through the application of machine learning techniques.

## Methods

In our study, we developed a novel neural network architecture that combines convolutional layers with attention mechanisms to better capture the spatial relationships between amino acids. The model was trained on a dataset of 50,000 known protein structures from the Protein Data Bank.

## Results

Our approach demonstrated significant improvements over existing methods:

1. 15% higher accuracy in predicting tertiary structure
2. 30% reduction in computational time
3. Better generalization to novel protein families

## Discussion

The results suggest that our approach can be valuable for understanding protein functions and interactions, which has implications for drug discovery and design.

## Conclusions

Our work demonstrates the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems in computational biology. Further research in this direction could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of protein structures and functions.
