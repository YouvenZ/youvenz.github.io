## Project Overview

This research project focuses on developing innovative machine learning techniques to address fundamental challenges in computational biology. By combining cutting-edge deep learning models with biological domain knowledge, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of various computational tasks in biology.

## Research Objectives

1. Develop novel neural network architectures tailored for biological sequence analysis
2. Create interpretable machine learning models that provide insights into biological mechanisms
3. Apply transfer learning techniques to leverage data across different biological problems
4. Build computationally efficient methods suitable for large-scale genomic and proteomic datasets

## Current Progress

Our team has developed a new attention-based neural network architecture that significantly improves protein structure prediction. The model has been validated on standard benchmark datasets and shows a 15% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
