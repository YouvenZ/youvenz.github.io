## Project Overview

This cutting-edge research project focuses on developing autonomous AI agent systems that leverage open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) through the CrewAI framework. Our goal is to create intelligent healthcare agents capable of collaborative decision-making, patient monitoring, and clinical workflow optimization.

## Research Objectives

1. Design multi-agent architectures using CrewAI framework for healthcare task coordination
2. Implement open-source LLMs (Llama 3.1, Mistral, Code Llama) for medical reasoning and documentation
3. Develop VLLM agents for medical image analysis and radiology report generation
4. Create interpretable agent decision-making processes for clinical transparency
5. Build scalable inference systems for real-time healthcare applications

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **CrewAI Framework**: Orchestrating multiple specialized healthcare agents
- **Open-Source Models**: Llama 3.1 70B, Mistral 7B, BioMistral, LLaVA-Med
- **Inference Engine**: vLLM for high-throughput model serving
- **Agent Roles**: Diagnostic Agent, Treatment Planning Agent, Monitoring Agent, Documentation Agent

### Agent Specializations
- **Clinical Diagnostician**: Analyzes symptoms and medical history using fine-tuned Llama models
- **Radiologist Assistant**: Processes medical images with LLaVA-Med for preliminary assessments
- **Treatment Coordinator**: Develops personalized treatment plans using medical knowledge bases
- **Documentation Specialist**: Generates clinical notes and reports using medical-specific language models

## Current Progress

Our team has successfully deployed a proof-of-concept system featuring four specialized agents working collaboratively on patient case analysis. The system demonstrates:

- 23% improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to single-model approaches
- 40% reduction in clinical documentation time
- 85% agreement rate with human specialists on treatment recommendations
- Real-time inference capabilities processing 500+ patient queries per hour

## Technical Implementation

### Model Infrastructure
- **Local Deployment**: Self-hosted open-source models ensuring data privacy
- **vLLM Serving**: Optimized inference with dynamic batching and GPU acceleration
- **Fine-tuning Pipeline**: Domain-specific adaptation on medical datasets
- **Agent Communication**: JSON-based protocol for inter-agent collaboration

### Performance Metrics
- Inference Latency: <2 seconds for routine queries
- Throughput: 50 tokens/second per agent
- Memory Efficiency: 24GB VRAM for full agent ensemble
- Accuracy: 92% on medical Q&A benchmarks
