&lt;p>Recent advances in deep learning have transformed many fields, including computational biology. In particular, protein structure prediction has been a long-standing challenge that has seen remarkable progress through the application of machine learning techniques.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="methods">Methods&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In our study, we developed a novel neural network architecture that combines convolutional layers with attention mechanisms to better capture the spatial relationships between amino acids. The model was trained on a dataset of 50,000 known protein structures from the Protein Data Bank.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Machine Learning for Computational Biology</title><link>https://youvenz.github.io/youvenz.github.io/research/research-bio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://youvenz.github.io/youvenz.github.io/research/research-bio/</guid><description>Developing novel machine learning approaches to solve challenging problems in computational biology.</description></item></channel></rss>
